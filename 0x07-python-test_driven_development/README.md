# Python Test-Driven Development

Tests are somewhat a pain to right amongst most developers in the tech ecosystem. 
From the number of tweets I've interacted with, most developers
shy away from writing tests. The process however deems to be productive 
and helpful. Testing involves assessing a software system and/or 
its component(s) to check if it meets the necessary requirements. Test-driven development
takes a more iterative approach of software testing.  
Although it might not assure 100% bug-free software, test-driven development helps in:  

* Reduction of potential costs in solving bugs in later development phases
* Reduction of time used in error diagnosis and fixing
* Covering edge cases, among other cool benefits

This project is done in fulfillment of project tasks aimed to practice
the skill of test-driven development by ALX Africa. Each file is a task solution
written by myself in Python.  
Every file has a corresponding test with the same filename and the .txt extension in the tests folder.
