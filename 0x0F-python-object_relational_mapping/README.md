# Python - ORM
This project aims to equip me with the skills to
connect a database server to my backend logic.  
MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy are both used extensively in the project,
specifically to understand the importance of abstraction.  
Moreover, an understanding of the pros and cons of both technologies
is acquired.
